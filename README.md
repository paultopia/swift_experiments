messing around with swift, ignore me

currently just trying to figure out how library and package manager work, basically running together `swift package init --type executable` with the bits of the perfect http server template that work right, and roughly triangulating on what actually is needed to get stuff to run.

detailed build docs apparently live at https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md#create-an-executable-package
